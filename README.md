# Python-Auto-Files-Organization
In a folder or in a drive we have different files with different extension like images  having extension [.jpg, .png, .jpeg], videos [extension .mp4, .mkv, .flv, .avi, ], pdfs,  docx file and so many more.Thats a bit tough to manage all these files. so, i have done a program for this auto files  organization that manages the files and with different extension and copy the files and kept the same group of files like all images  into a image folder and all videos into a videos folder and so on...
